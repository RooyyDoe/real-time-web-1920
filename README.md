## Application concept

In this application the users are able to start a pokemon battle with each other. A pokemon trainer has to pick a pokemon that is going to fight along their side. the pokemon trainers can select attacks for each pokemon to attack the opponent. The fight will go on till one of the pokemon has fainted, which will happen when the health bar reaches zero. After a battle the winning pokemon trainer gets the gold.

If you sign up to be a pokemon trainer you will be able to select five pokemons which then will be your own. These pokemons all have four attacks that you can use to attack your opponents with in a real pokemon battle.
